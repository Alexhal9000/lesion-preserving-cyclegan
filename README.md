# Stroke Lesion Preserving CycleGAN
## A modified CycleGAN that encourages stroke lesion regions to be preserved with an attention module.
## Brain morphology is also preserved with a gradient correlation loss.
## Data augmentation with elastic deformations significantly improves performance with low data availability.
